I have a string in format of bits like next 101010100101011111000111,
how can I write it in File of size of lenth of bits straing into bits, maybe using .bat extention for file.
I work in c#
This C# program will convert the binary string into bytes and save it to a file named "output.bat."
The contents of the .bat file will be the binary data. You can replace the binaryString variable with
your actual binary string
